# Description

This project ('[Brago](https://github.com/kfishkin/brago)') was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


This is a React app that takes a JSON file created by
Jake Croteau's Raid Extractor, and lets you examine it
in various simple ways. See the 'Help' command in the app
for more details.

This is my first React app, and was written as a personal
learning experiment, so be gentle with your comments :)
